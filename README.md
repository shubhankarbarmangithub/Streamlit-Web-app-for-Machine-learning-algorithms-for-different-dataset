# Streamlit-Web-app-for-Machine-learning-algorithms-for-different-dataset

This is an interactive web page for any ML project, feel feel free to use it. 
This dataset is fetched from the UCI Machine learning repository. The analysis in here is to demonstrate how we can present our work to our stakeholders in an interractive way by building a web app for our machine learning algorithms using different dataset.
